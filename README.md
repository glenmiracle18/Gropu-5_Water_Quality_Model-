## Project Objective
The goal is to build a neural network-based classification model while applying optimization techniques like L1 regularization, dropout, and early stopping. These techniques help reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization.

## Model Architecture
The architecture of the neural network consists of:

### Convolutional Layers
- First layer with 32 filters and a kernel size of 3
- Second layer with 64 filters and a kernel size of 3
- Regularization: L1 regularization applied to convolutional and dense layers
- Dropout: Applied to prevent overfitting
- Pooling Layer: MaxPooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions
- Fully Connected Layer: Dense layer with 64 units
- Output Layer: Dense layer with 1 output neuron and sigmoid activation

## Optimization Techniques

### L1 Regularization
- Adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights to reduce overfitting
- `l1_lambda=0.01`

### Dropout
- Randomly drops neurons during training to prevent overfitting
- `dropout_rate=0.5`

### Early Stopping
- Monitors validation loss and stops training when performance stops improving
- `patience=5`

### Optimizer
- RMSprop optimizer with a custom learning rate of 0.001
