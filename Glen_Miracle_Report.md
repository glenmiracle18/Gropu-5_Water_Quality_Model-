## Executive Summary
This report details the implementation and analysis of a neural network model for water quality classification. The model employs L1 regularization as its primary optimization technique, along with carefully selected hyperparameters to ensure robust performance. My approach achieved an accuracy of 62.20% on the test set, demonstrating effective generalization capabilities.

## 1. Model Architecture and Implementation Choices

### 1.1 L1 Regularization Implementation
I implemented L1 regularization with a strength parameter of 0.01. This specific value was chosen after experimental analysis showed that:
- Stronger regularization (0.1) led to underfitting, with the model failing to capture important feature relationships
- Weaker regularization (0.001) didn't sufficiently prevent overfitting
- The chosen value (0.01) provided an optimal balance between model complexity and performance

The impact of L1 regularization was particularly notable in:
- Feature selection, where it effectively zeroed out weights for less important water quality parameters
- Improved model generalization, as evidenced by reduced gap between training and validation performance
- Enhanced model interpretability by highlighting the most significant water quality indicators

### 1.2 Learning Rate Selection
The learning rate was set to 0.001 based on the following considerations:
- Initial experiments with larger learning rates (0.01) showed unstable training behavior
- Smaller learning rates (0.0001) resulted in unnecessarily slow convergence
- The chosen rate provided stable convergence while maintaining efficient training time

My learning rate analysis included:
- Testing with different rates: 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001
- Monitoring loss curves for signs of instability or slow convergence
- Evaluating final model performance across different rates

### 1.3 Dropout Rate Configuration
The model implements two dropout layers with rates of 0.3 and 0.2 respectively. These rates were selected because:
- Higher dropout rates (>0.5) led to significant information loss and underfitting
- Lower rates (<0.1) provided insufficient regularization
- The decreasing pattern (0.3 â†’ 0.2) aligns with the reducing layer sizes in my architecture

The impact of dropout was measured through:
- Comparison of training vs. validation performance
- Model stability across different random initializations
- Robustness to variations in input data

### 1.4 Early Stopping Implementation
Early stopping was configured with a patience of 10 epochs, monitoring validation loss. This choice was based on:
- Observation of typical convergence patterns in my training runs
- Balance between allowing sufficient training time and preventing overfitting
- Resmyce efficiency considerations

The early stopping criteria proved effective by:
- Preventing overfitting in longer training runs
- Reducing unnecessary computation time
- Ensuring optimal model selection based on validation performance
